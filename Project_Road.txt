** Programming Languages:
Next.js    
Typescript
TailwindCSS

✅Next.js is a React-based framework that enables developers to build fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications. 
It offers powerful features like server-side rendering (SSR), 
static site generation (SSG), and API routes, making it suitable for modern web development.

✅TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, interfaces, and other advanced features to enhance the development experience, 
improve code quality, and make debugging easier. 
It compiles to plain JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with all JavaScript runtimes.

✅TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design directly in the markup by using pre-defined classes. 
This approach provides flexibility, faster development, 
and better maintainability compared to traditional CSS or component-based frameworks.

Using Next.js with TypeScript provides type safety, 
improved code quality, and enhanced developer experience when building modern web applications. 
Next.js is a React-based framework for server-rendered, static, 
and hybrid web applications, and TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript with static typing.

 ✅ShadCN UI ==> Component library == that leverages Radix UI and Tailwind CSS to provide accessible, customizable, 
 and pre-built components for modern web development.

 ✅Clerk ==> Authentication(Sign-in, Sign-up)

 ✅Database == MongoDB & Mongoose

 MongoDB is a NoSQL database known for its flexibility, scalability, and ability to handle unstructured or semi-structured data. 
 Unlike traditional relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), MongoDB uses a document-oriented model, storing data in JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON).

 Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. 
 It provides a structured and convenient way to interact with MongoDB by defining schemas and models for your data.

 ✅Stripe ==> technology company that provides a suite of payment processing software 
 and APIs for online and in-person businesses

 ✅Cloudinary == Cloudinary is a cloud-based service designed for managing, 
 storing, and delivering media assets such as images and videos. 
 It provides a rich API for uploading, transforming, optimizing, 
 and delivering assets in real-time, making it a popular choice for modern web and mobile applications.
